    <h1>Chapter 7: Software Engineering</h1>

<table border="1" style = "width: 100%; margin:auto;">
    <tr><td>
<h1>Software Engineering</h1>
    <ul><li>The branch of computer science that seeks principles to guide the development of large, complex software systems.</li></ul> 

<h2>Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</h2>
    <ul><li>combine tools for developing software (editors, compilers, debugging tools, and so on) into a single, integrated package.</li></ul>

<h2>Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)</h2>
    <ul>
   <li class="indent-1">Purpose of ACM: Researches and shares information on computing technology in order to further improve today's computers.</li>
   <li class="indent-1">Benefits of ACM: ACM offers access to online courses, videos, books, etc.</li>
   <li class="indent-1">Student ACM membership: Unlimited access to ACM's thousands of books, courses, trainings from multiple brands, and even offers cerifications.</li> 
    </ul>

<h2>Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</h2>
    <ul>
    <li class="indent-1">Purpose of IEEE: Development of standards for computer networking and networks.</li>
    <li class="indent-1">Benefits of IEEE: Offers opportunity to aquire new skills and advance development of networks.</li>
    <li class="indent-1">Student IEEE membership: Connect with local professionsals, funds for traveling, scholarships, learning an advanced trade.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Software Life Cycle: Development Phase:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li class="indent-1">Requirement ananysis: Specify what services the proposed system will provide, to identify any conditions (time constraints, security, and so on) on those services, and to define how the outside world will interact with the system.</li>
    <li class="indent-1">Design: Creating a plan for the construction of the proposed system. In a sense, requirements analysis is about identifying the problem to be solved, while design is about developing a solution to the problem.</li>
    <li class="indent-1">Implementation: The actual writing of programs, creation of data files, and development of databases. It is at the implementation stage that we see the distinction between the tasks of a software analyst (sometimes referred to as a system analyst) and a programmer.</li>
    <li class="indent-1">Testing: Testing is now recognized as only one segment in the overall struggle for quality assurance, which is an objective that permeates the entire software life cycle.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Modular Implementation:</h2>
    <ul><li>Identifies the functions and indicates the dependencies among the functions.</li></ul>

<h2>Unified Modular Language (UML):</h2>
    <ul><li>Developed with the object-oriented paradigm in mind. The first tool that we consider within this collection, however, is useful regardless of the underlying paradigm because it attempts merely to capture the image of the proposed system from the user's point of view.</li></ul>

<h2>Use Case:</h2>
    <ul><li>Use case diagrams view a proposed software system from the outside.</li></ul>

<h2>Use Case Diagram:</h2>
    <ul><li>Depicts the proposed system as a large rectangle in which interactions (called use cases) between the system and its users are represented as ovals and users of the system (called actors) are represented as stick figures (even though an actor may not be a person).</li></ul>

<h2>Data Relationships:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>One-to-One: Exemplified by the association between patients and occupied private rooms in that each patient is associated with only one room and each room is associated with only one patient.</li>
        <li>One-to-Many: Exemplified by the association between physicians and patients in that one physician is associated with many patients and each patient is associated with one (primary) physician.</li>
        <li>Many-to-Many: Would occur if we included consulting physicians in the physician-patient relationship. Then each physician could be associated with many patients and each patient could be associated with many physicians.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Design Pattern: </h2>
    <ul><li>A predeveloped model for solving a recurring problem in software design.</li></ul>

<h2>Software Quality Assurance (SQA):</h2>
    <ul><li>Charged with overseeing and enforcing the quality control systems adopted by the organization. </li></ul>

<h2>Software Testing:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Glass Box Testing: Meaning that the software tester is aware of the interior structure of the software and uses this knowledge when designing the test.</li>
        <li>Black Box Testing: Refers to tests that do not rely on knowledge of the software's interior composition.</li>
        <li>Beta Testing: Preliminary version of the software is given to a segment of the intended audience with the goal of learning how the software performs in real-life situations before the final version of the product is solidified and released to the market.</li>
        <li>Alpha Testing: Similar to beta testing, but performed on the developer's point of view instead.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Documentation:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>User Documentation: Explains the features of the software and describe how to use them. It is intended to be read by the user of the software and is therefore expressed in the terminology of the application.</li>
        <li>System Documentation: Describes the software's internal composition so that the software can be maintained later in its life cycle. A major component of system documentation is the source version of all the programs in the system.</li>
        <li>Technical Documentation: Describes how a software system should be installed and serviced (such as adjusting operating parameters, installing updates, and reporting problems back to the software's developer). Technical documentation of software is analogous to the documentation provided to mechanics in the automobile industry.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Intellectual Property Law:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Software License: A legal agreement between the owner and user of a software product that grants the user certain permissions to use the product without transferring ownership rights to the intellectual property.</li>
        <li>Software Disclamer: The software developer's formal notice to the user of its software that the developer is denying any and all liability for any damages arising out of using the software as well as denying any implied warranties.</li>
        <li>Best Defense Against Software Liability Claims: One of the best defenses against software liability claims is to apply sound software engineering principles during the software's development, to use a level of care compatible with the software's application, and to produce and maintain records that validate these endeavors.</li>
    </ul>
