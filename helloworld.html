            When programmers are learning a new programming language,
            they often learn to code with a simple program called "Hello World."
            That is what I am doing with this HTML code!

            <li>Radius: 3,959 miles</li>
            <li>Fifth largest planet in the solar system</li>
            <li>Water covers 70% of the surface</li>
            <li>Not a perfect sphere; it is wider around its middle</li>
            <li>Spinning at just over 1,000 milers per hour</li>
